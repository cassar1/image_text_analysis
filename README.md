# image_text_analysis
The project consists of a jupyter notebook skeleton in python to identify text from images based on https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-vision-api-python/index.html?index=..%2F..index#7 using Google Vision API. 

Given an image, it is sent to the Vision API, and a rectangle is drawn around each text instance identified in the image.
